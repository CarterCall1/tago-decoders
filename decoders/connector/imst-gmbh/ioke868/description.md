The [iOKE868 Smart Metering Kit](https://wireless-solutions.de/products/lora-ioke868-smart-metering-kit.html) compliant with LoRaWAN® leverages the long range and low power of LoRa® to provide real-time data monitoring of energy consumption and secure connectivity to a LoRaWAN® IoT network. It is compatible with most modern smart meters (compliant with IEC62056-21 and SML messages). The optical reading unit iO881A can be attached magnetically to the smart meter to read out the infrared interface, extract the desired values and transfer those to a LoRaWAN® network with a period defined by the user. The external antenna provides a maximum flexibility during installation in difficult RF environments. The user-friendly configuration tool offers an easy way to change the radio, calendar and filter settings. All these advantages result in a far more comprehensive and detailed feedback on energy consumption and enable a significant reduction of operational costs. The configuration can be managed Over-The-Air via LoRa® messages or via wired serial interface (Windows PC tool).
