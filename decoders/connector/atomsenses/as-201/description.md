The Atomsenses AS-102 / AS-201 CO2 Sensor is a highly accurate and competitively priced LoRaWAN sensor.

It utilizes CMOSens® Technology for precise Carbon Dioxide measurements. It also features NDIR measurement technology for CO₂ detection with integrated humidity and temperature sensor.

Our special algorithms enable accurate measurement of ambient humidity and temperature by compensating for external heat sources without extra components.

The sensor has an Ultra-low Power design and smart firmware, allowing it to last up to 5 years with two AA-type batteries. It can transmit data over long distances to any brand of LoRaWAN gateway.
