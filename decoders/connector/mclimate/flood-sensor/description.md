The MClimate Flood Sensor contains a flood sensor for detecting floods and water leakage in residential and commercial buildings. In addition to that, the MClimate flood sensor contains a device tampering detection sensor and a temperature sensor. When a flood or fraud is detected an uplink containing the desired values is transferred to the LoRaWANÂ® network.
